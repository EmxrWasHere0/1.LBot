# 1.L Bot
**A way to make your server full with fun!**
## How to use it?
> Get a bot token at [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by creating a new application and going to **Bot** tab.
> 
> Get a Spotify ID and Secret from [here](developer.spotify.com).
> 
> Paste the bot's token to `BOT_TOKEN`, Client ID to `SO_ID` and Client Secret to `SP_SECRET`
And voila! You are ready to run 1.L Bot, after redirect URI verification of Spotify.

## How to customize it?
**⚠️** If you don't know anything about Python or `discord.py`, please **DO NOT** touch `@bot.command` and `@bot.tree.command` sections.
> Set the prefix by changing the `command_prefix` variable.
> 
> Customize the respondes by changing `await ctx.reply` or `await i.response.send_message` commands.
>
> Set to another website by changing links on commands.

That's it, bye 👋
